# Capacitive Sensor Experiments
Trying to get this to work. Graphs are helping a lot to show that something is actually happening.

## Concept

The sensor detects touch by measuring the charging time of the "capacitor".  When a finger is touching/near the sensor pad, the capacitance increases, causing the time to increase.
